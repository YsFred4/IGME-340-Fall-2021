## VIII. Software
We will be learning to develop mobile apps using Xamarin (C#) and Visual Studio. normally Android is developed using Android Studio and iOS is developed with XCode.  We are going to be making mobile apps for both using C#. Every student can and should get the enterprise version of Visual Studio from the department website using this link. If you have any issue getting it, the free community edition will work.

- [Microsoft Dreamspark](https://www.rit.edu/computing/computing/school-interactive-games-and-media/resources/labs-and-technology-resources#downloadable-software)

If you get visual Studio for the Mac, you can develop mobile apps for iOS and/or Android.  If you install on windows, you can develop mobile apps for iOS and/or Android but to compile for iOS a Mac will be needed at some point.  This will be gone over in class.

To get the emulators to work much better, please make sure that you have hardware virtualization turned on your machine at the BIOS level as well as installing it in Windows.  There should be a video on that already. If you have any issue, please make sure to contact me ASAP.  This will be a night and day change once it is setup correctly.

We will be going over ways of testing both types of apps on your personal devices (yes even iOS without a Mac).  Much of the time we will be using the built in emulators.

The second project will be using Unity for making a mobile app since it has its own issues when it comes to running on mobile. There will be videos on this that will be posted to the course server.

## XI. Class Delivery

This class will be delivered in an asynchronous method.  Many (25 or so) of the videos and assignments are going to be available on day 1.  The class can be done as fast as you want and you could be done with it in shorter time than the whole semester if you really want to push yourself.  

We will have a weekly discord meeting just to have a checkin to make sure if there are any questions. I will record them for people that cannot attend.  I will also have office hours on Discord and can usually be contacted on Discord at anytime of the day.  Attendance is NOT mandatory

The videos might occasionally have a "co-host", who was a IGM student that graduated in 2019 and also has worked in Xamarin before.

## XII. How to succeed in this class

Mobile development can be difficult for newcomers. Xamarin is about 12 years old for using C# develop mobile apps, but sometimes figuring out how to do something with this "non-standard" system can be tricky. You may have to work harder than you are used to, especially at the beginning.

* Go over the videos and slides for each class. There are going to be times you might want to go back and review something and the videos help with this.
* Do the assignments and complete the Study Guides. Be sure to save your Study Guides - future test questions will be pulled from them and the in-class assignments.
* Take notes - either handwritten or electronically (Markdown, Word Doc, or Google Doc). It will help you to pay attention and remember the material even with the class being delivered with videos.
* Start assignments early! Don't wait until the night before.
* On the projects, do portfolio quality work that you would be willing to show a potential employer or publish to the mobile stores.
* Ask questions in class/Discord for clarification
* Contact me over Discord, email or phone if you are having trouble.
* **Install apps on your hardware** you'll lose points otherwise! Don't just run everything in the emulator. Why?
Your app is "cooler" when it's on your phone/tablet, even if it's just a lame demo.
Usability issues are often immediately apparent, especially when you let someone else try the app.
There are times where apps install faster and run faster on your device than they do on the emulators.



## XIII. Grading

- Projects: 70%
- Exercises: 30%

Final course grades are determined using the following scale: 

| Class Average | Grade |
| ------------- | ----- |
| 90+% 	| A |
| 80+%	| B |
| 70+%	| C |
| 60+%	| D |
| <60%	| F |


Note: Grade A = superior work, not just satisfactory.

Note: There are no make-ups and no extra credit.

Note: HW and ICE will NOT be accepted late without a valid excuse (procrastination, and missing the dropbox by 1 minute, are not valid excuses). If you feel you have legitimate excuse, please contact the professor outside of class either by email or during office hours. The lowest homework grade will be automatically dropped by mycourses, so you can get a zero on 1 assignment and not be penalized.

Note: Late projects are sometimes accepted.

Note: The MAXIMUM grade awarded on any "late project" is an 85%

## XIV. Academic Integrity
ANY instance of academic dishonesty (cheating, collusion, or duplicate submission) will result in a failing grade in the course and will be reported to the chair of the student's home department. This policy includes all assignments, including seemingly trivial ones like homework. There will be no second chances given.

## XV. Notices of Accommodation
If you have a "Notice of Accommodation", I should have received a copy electronically. Please discuss this with me after class or during office hours, so that I can make sure all of your accommodations are met.

## XVI. Important RIT Deadlines
- Last day of add/drop is the beginning of week 2.
- Last day to withdraw with a grade of W is the end of week 11.
- You have one semester to challenge your grade. After that, grades cannot be challenged (IGM department policy).
- All of the information on this page is subject to change.
